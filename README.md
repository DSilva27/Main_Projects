# My main software development projects
This is a compilation software development projects related to cryo-EM where I have collaborated or acted as the main developer.

* [cryoJAX](https://github.com/mjo22/cryojax) - A flexible and differentiable simulator for cryo-EM data from volumes or atomic structures. Generates data compatible with Relion / Cryosparc. Developed the simulator from atomic models, PDB/mmCIF reading interface, and the generation of datasets.
* [cryoJAX-MD](https://github.com/DSilva27/cryo_MD) - Currently private, and possibly will change names. This project focuses on the development of a physics-guided ensemble optimization pipeline using cryoJAX. Main developer.
* [Cryo-EM Heterogeneity Challenge](https://github.com/flatironinstitute/Cryo-EM-Heterogeneity-Challenge-1) - Preprocessing and Analysis pipeline for the Cryo-EM Heterogeneity Challenge. Developed the preprocessing pipeline, and the PCA metric.
* [cryoSBI](https://github.com/flatironinstitute/cryoSBI) - A simulation-based inference pipeline for estimating the posterior probability of conformational structures given cryo-EM data. Set the basis for the initial design of the API, collaborated in testing/developing the current API.
* [cryosvd](https://github.com/flatironinstitute/cryosvd) - (name subject to change). Adapted the PCA pipeline from the Cryo-EM Challenge for the analysis of volume series obtained by different heteregeneity methods.
* [Modified Expectation Maximization](https://github.com/DSilva27/em_variation) - Currently private, and name subjecto to change. Implementation of the 2D Clasisfication pipline in cryo-EM. This pipeline was developed using cryoJAX. This includes a modification to the EM algorithm that avoids the effects of class-membership bias when computing the responsibilities.
